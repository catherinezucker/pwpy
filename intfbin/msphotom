msphotom vis=<MS> [keywords...]

Extract photometry from the visibilities in a measurement set. See
below the keyword docs for some important caveats.

vis=
  Path of the MeasurementSet dataset to read. Required.

out=
  Path to which data will be written. If unspecified, data are written
  to standard output.

rephase=RA,DEC
  Phase the data to extract fluxes in the specified direction. If
  unspecified, the data are not rephased, i.e. the flux at the
  phase center is extracted. RA and DEC should be in sexigesimal
  with fields separated by colons.

array=, baseline=, field=, observation=, polarization=, scan=,
scanintent=, spw=, taql=, time=, uvdist=
  MeasurementSet selectors used to filter the input data.
  Default polarization is 'RR,LL'. All polarizations are averaged
  together, so mixing parallel- and cross-hand pols is almost
  never what you want to do.

datacol=
  Name of the column to use for visibility data. Defaults to 'data'.
  You might want it to be 'corrected_data'.

datascale=
  Multiply fluxes by this number before reporting them. Defaults to
  1e6, so that the output is in terms of microjanskys if the data are
  correctly flux-scaled. The textual output has two decimal places so
  adjusting this value can give better results if your characteristic
  fluxes are significantly different than this.

believeweights=[t|f]
  Defaults to false, which means that we assume that the 'weight'
  column in the dataset is NOT scaled such that the variance in the
  visibility samples is equal to 1/weight. In this case
  uncertainties are assessed from the scatter of all the visibilities
  in each timeslot. If true, we trust that variance=1/weight and
  propagate this in the standard way.

format=[humane(default)|pandas]
  The format of the output. The default is "humane" which is described
  below. The "pandas" format is slightly less human-friendly but can
  be read directly into a Pandas DataFrame with pandas.read_table ().

IMPORTANT: the fundamental assumption of this task is that the only
signal in the visibilities is from a point source at the phasing
center. We also assume that all sampled polarizations get equal
contributions from the source (though you can resample the Stokes
parameters on the fly, so this is not quite the same thing as
requiring the source be unpolarized).

Prints out

  MJD(TT) dt[min] re reErr im imErr mag magErr npts

with sorted MJDs, one record for each timestamp present in the dataset,
with all fluxes in ujy. dt is simply (MJD - MJD[0]) * 1440. The units
of re, im, mag, and their uncertainties are microjansky by default,
but see the datascale keyword, and there's no way to know if the
data have actually been flux-calibrated or not.
